Now we will show some examples of Xsemantics systems (type systems and possibly
operation semantics/interpreter) for some languages implemented in Xtext.
</p>
<p>
The presented examples are available as an installable feature from the
update site.  Once installed, you will find project wizards for the example
languages, as shown in the screenshot

<p>
For each example language included in Xsemantics, you will then find
a wizard which creates a project to experiment with that example language,
and a wizard to materialize in the workspace the sources of the
projects for that example language. (the sources are also available 
from the git repository, see <a href="02-GettingStarted.html#Sources" title="Go to &quot;Sources&quot;" >section Sources</a>).
