chapter:Examples[Examples]

Now we will show some examples of Xsemantics systems (type systems and possibly
operation semantics/interpreter) for some languages implemented in Xtext.

The presented examples are available as an installable feature from the
update site.  Once installed, you will find project wizards for the example
languages.  If you want to inspect the sources, you can retrieve them
from the git repository (see ref:Sources[]).
